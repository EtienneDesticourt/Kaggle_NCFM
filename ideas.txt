For the first submission I simply used the inceptionV3 model from keras with a tensorflow backend
and a random 80:20 train/validation split. It took 110 minutes to train.

For the second submission I used a subsample of the total training data to be able to train the model faster
and test hypotheses with the same method as submission 1. It took 10 minutes to train. I concluded that subsampling achieved its goal.

For the third submission I relabeled some images in the subsample. The LB loss increased from submission 2 even though the val
loss decreased. I couldn't conclude on the usefulness of relabeling. I concluded that I need to implement k-fold CV to have
a val-loss/LB-loss correspondance for future tests.


Cluster by boats
Black-out unchanged background
Remove duplicate/sequential images for faster training
Correctly relabel dataset
Get validation split by removing sequences
Data augmentation average
Feed into SVM
Split by Day/Night

#TODO:

Add kfold cv to have  meaningful score
Relabel
Sort by boat
Sort by day night
